# Udemy Instructor Dashboard

A self-hosted **MERN-style dashboard** for Udemy instructors: see all your
courses, ratings, reviews, Q&A, enrollment, and (optionally) revenue in one
place — with search, sort, and CSV export.

Built around what the Udemy Instructor API actually exposes (which is less than
you'd expect), with documented workarounds for the rest.

- **Express** backend that proxies the Udemy Instructor API (your key stays server-side)
- **React + Vite** frontend: searchable/sortable table, per-course detail drawer, CSV export
- **Playwright** scrapers for the data the API doesn't expose (enrollment, revenue, coupons)
- One-command **Render** deploy, gated by HTTP basic auth

---

## What the Udemy API does and doesn't give you

This was the hard-won part. Verified against the live API:

| Data | Available? | Source used here |
|------|-----------|------------------|
| Courses, ratings, review counts, published state | ✅ API | `GET /instructor-api/v1/taught-courses/courses/` (`fields[course]=@all`) |
| Reviews (rating + text) | ✅ API | `/taught-courses/reviews/?course=<id>` |
| Q&A | ✅ API | `/taught-courses/questions/?course=<id>` |
| **Student count / enrollment** | ❌ Not in API | Scraped from public course pages (Playwright) |
| **Revenue** | ❌ Not in API, not public | Authenticated scrape (your session) |
| **Coupons** | ❌ Not in API | Authenticated scrape / browser automation |
| **Caption / subtitle languages** | ❌ Not in API, not public | Authenticated scrape of `caption_locales` (your session) |

Notes for anyone building on the Udemy API:
- Auth is a **single key sent as `Authorization: Bearer <key>`** — *not* Basic auth / client-id+secret.
- The **Affiliate API was discontinued Jan 2025**; the Instructor API is in maintenance mode.
- Course IDs are opaque strings ending in `==` — pass them as query params, don't URL-encode into a path.

## Quick start

### 1. Get an API key
Udemy instructor account → API key. Put it in `server/.env` (copy from `.env.example`):

```
UDEMY_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

### 2. Run it
```bash
# backend
cd server && npm install && npm run test:auth && npm run dev   # http://localhost:5055

# frontend (separate terminal)
cd client && npm install && npm run dev                        # http://localhost:5173
```

## API (backend)
| Route | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `GET /api/health` | Is the key configured? |
| `GET /api/courses` | All taught courses (+ merged enrollment/revenue if scraped) |
| `GET /api/reviews?course=<id>` | Reviews for a course |
| `GET /api/questions?course=<id>` | Q&A for a course |
| `GET /api/udemy/*` | Generic passthrough to any instructor endpoint |

## Enrollment scraping (optional)
The API doesn't expose student counts, so they're scraped from public course pages:

```bash
cd server
npx playwright install chromium   # one-time
npm run scrape:enrollment         # caches to server/enrollment-cache.json
```

Udemy is behind Cloudflare, which rate-limits rapid same-session requests — so the
scraper uses a **fresh browser context per course** + a short delay (≈100% coverage,
intentionally slow). Re-runs **skip already-cached courses**; `--force` refreshes all.
The dashboard merges the cache automatically.

## Revenue & coupons (optional, authenticated)
These live only behind your Udemy login. Udemy blocks automated *logins*, so the
reliable path is to reuse your existing session via a cookie export:

1. Install the **Cookie-Editor** browser extension, open udemy.com logged in.
2. Export udemy.com cookies as JSON → save to `server/udemy-cookies.json`.
3. `npm run import:cookies` → writes a gitignored `udemy-auth.json` session.
4. `npm run discover` → captures the authenticated page structure to build parsers.

All session/financial files (`udemy-auth.json`, `udemy-cookies.json`,
`revenue-cache.json`, browser profiles) are **gitignored** and never deployed.

## Deploy (Render)
A single web service serves the API + built frontend, protected by HTTP basic auth.

1. Push to your own GitHub repo.
2. Render → **New + → Blueprint** → connect the repo (it reads `render.yaml`).
3. Set env vars: `UDEMY_API_KEY`, `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD` (and optionally `DASHBOARD_USER`, default `admin`).
4. Deploy → browser prompts for the password on first load.

> The deploy serves live API data in real time. Scraped data (enrollment/revenue)
> comes from cache files, which are gitignored — populate them locally and supply
> via a Render disk, or run the scrapers on a private always-on host.

## Security
- The API key lives only in `server/.env` / host secrets — never in the repo or the browser.
- The dashboard exposes private course data; always deploy it **password-protected**.
- Authenticated scraping reuses your Udemy session — keep `udemy-auth.json` private.
